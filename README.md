## QUESTION 1

### The functional requirements of the  LIS system are as follows:
* The system should include a feature of issuing a book.
* The system should include search capabilities. One should be able to search using the author's name, title of the book, edition, and so on.
* The system should save the book issuer's information, as well as the time and title of the book.
* For LIS members who have issued books, the system should have a deadline extension feature. If a member seeks an extension and the book is already reserved by someone else during the extension duration, the member's request should be rejected; otherwise, the request should be allowed and the previously stored information updated.
* There should be an authentication system in place because only legitimate people who are LIS system members should be able to issue or return books.
* When a book or newsletter has already been handed to another person, the user must still be able to reserve it.
* If the member already issued the items, the pre-booking request should be rejected.
* Updation and removal options should be there for already existing books or newsletter.
* It is essential to provide filters that make it simple to customise and conduct searches.
* There should be reminder for book returning deadline through mail or any other stuff.


### The non functional requirements are as follows:
* To achieve good performance, the website or system must work swiftly and smoothly, and it must maintain that efficiency over time.
* The web application should also be responsive with small screen and mobile phone.
* The web application should run in institute LAN only.
* The system should offer crash recovery, error management, and little possibility for errors.
* The encryption should done properly to avoid any cyber attack.
* The system should be scalable in order to support a huge number of user requests. 


## QUESTION 2

The challenge's objective is to create a smartphone application using artificial intelligence to detect significant sound events of interest to the population that satisfies the everyday needs of those with substantial hearing loss. This applicaton will also be great support to the partially deaf people.

### The functional requirements are as follows:
* A username and password should be set up for each user by user to prevent data loss or corruption by an unknown party.
* There should be a username password, google and facebook authentication.
* When a crucial sound event occurs, it should immediately send out an alarm and keep ringing until the user stops it.
* Once the user starts recording, it should be able to continuously capture sound.
* Additionally, it must to contain an increasing vibration as the user gets closer to the object.

### The non functional requirements are as follows:
* The password used in the authentication system should be encrypted properly to avoid any cyber attack.
* The application should run in ios as well as latest android versions.
* The application's latency should be not more than few mili-seconds.
* The application should be lite weight and scalable.
* The application should also be responsive with small screen and mobile phone.
